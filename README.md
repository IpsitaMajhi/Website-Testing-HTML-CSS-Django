In today's fast-paced digital landscape, ensuring the reliability, security, and performance of 
web applications is crucial for businesses to thrive. Manual testing can be time-consuming 
and error-prone, leading to potential oversight of critical issues. To address these challenges, 
our Automated Website Testing Tool provides a comprehensive solution designed to 
streamline and enhance the testing process. This tool integrates multiple testing disciplines, 
including security testing, GUI testing, unit testing, and performance testing, to ensure your 
web application meets the highest standards of quality and functionality.
